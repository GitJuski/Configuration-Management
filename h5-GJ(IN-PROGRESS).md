# Introduction

This is the report for homework assignment number five. As per usual, this assignment is divided into subtasks which are the following:

- Task x. Read and summarize. Choose a homework report from an earlier course and summarize it with a couple of bullet points. The topic is Saltstack on Windows.

- Task a. Install Salt on Windows or Mac. Demonstrate that it works with a command. A demonstration is sufficient if you have it already installed.

- Task b. Gather information from Windows or Mac with grains.items functionality. Choose a couple of key values and analyze them.

- Task c. Try the Salt's file.state on Windows or Mac.

- Task d. Show the files last modified with the find command. The scope here is only limited to /etc/ and /home directories. 

- Task e. Create a Salt state that creates a new command.

- Task f. Optional. Modify the settings of some GUI application. Find the settings inside the file system.

- Task g. Optional. Create a Salt state that creates a directory full of commands. Create the state using recurse parameter so that you don't need to create individual commands/scripts.

# Practical tasks

## Essential information

At the time of starting this I was at home in Vaasa. I used a good wireless connection and I had 257 GB of free space in my SSD. The rest of the information can be read from this image:

## Task a. Install Salt on windows

I started this task in April 25, 2024 at 5:36 PM.

I opened PowerShell as admin by right clicking it and selecting the corresponding line.

I had to start the salt-minion service since I've set it to not start automatically. I clicked on the Windows key + R to open the run interface. I wrote services.msc and hit enter.

I found the salt-minion and clicked on it. Then on the left I pressed 'Start'.

Then I tested that It responds with a simple command.

I was done at 5:38 PM.

## Task b. Gather information

I started this task at 5:44 PM.

I started by making my way to a directory I had already created during the last lecture. hello.txt was a leftover from my experimentation with salt.file during the class. Anyway, I wanted to check the options before choosing a couple of items to analyze more in depth. So, I got the whole output with `salt-call --local grains.items` and with `> output.txt` I forwarded the whole thing into a new text file called output.txt.

![1](screenshots/5/5.png)

Then I opened the file in VSCode `code output.txt`. I use tab a lot, which is why the command looks like this `code .\output.txt` in the terminal. I read through the file and found a couple of things. To further investigate, I used `salt-call --local grains.item locale_info saltversion shell`.

- locale_info shows a couple of things:

    - defaultencoding - > According to a wikipedia article (edited in 2024) "Windows-1252 is a single-byte character encoding of the latin alphabet" and that "It is the most-used single-byte character encoding in the world". Character encoding is essentially a ruleset for a machine to turn machine language into human language (letters, numbers, special characters etc.)

    - defaultlanguage -> I'm using US-English as my preferred language on my machine.

    - detectedencoding -> This makes me think that the defaultenconding is most of the time if not always Windows-1252 if the OS is Windows. The detected encoding on the other hand tells us that I'm using UTF-8 instead of the default 1252. According to another Wikipedia article (Edited on in 2024) "UTF-8 is a variable-length character encoding standard used for electronic communication.".

    - timezone is the timezone my machine is in. The daylight time probably refers to "Kes√§aika" summer time.

- saltversion is the version of salt-minion currently in use. The version 3007.0 seems to be the newest version at this time. The release notes can be found here https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/releases/3007.0.html. The version before was 3006.7 (Saltproject 2024).

- shell shows us the default shell which is the cmd (Command Prompt) in this case. Bash is the default on my Linux instances. I really don't use cmd that much. I prefer PowerShell instead.

I was done at 5:48 PM.

## Task c. file.state

I started this at 6:40 PM.

These are the leftovers of the experimentations.

![1](screenshots/5/7.png)

I removed them with `rm hello.txt` and `rm .\srv\salt\hello`. I had to type yes since I didn't use recursive.

I created a new directory with `mkdir .\srv\salt\hello\`. There I created a new file with `code .\srv\salt\hello\init.sls`. I kinda wanted to make a file that gets added and then deleted a minute later. I looked around the net for a bit, but in the end, I just decided to do a simple hello world since I had other things to take care of. Here's the contents.

![1](screenshots/5/8.png)

I had changed directory for no reason `cd .\srv\salt`. I tested the file. I copied the paths to avoid human error. It worked as expected.

![1](screenshots/5/9.png)

I tested it again to verify idempotence.

I was done at 6:48 PM.

## Task d. Find.

COMING SOON...

## Task e. Command.

COMING SOON...

## Optional: GUI.

COMING SOON...

## Optional: A box full of commands.

COMING SOON...
